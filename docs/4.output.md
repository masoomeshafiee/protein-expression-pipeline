# Outputs
Outputs are saved in the output directory.

## 1. processed_data.csv`
Main data table containing:
- File Name
- Cell ID
- Focal Slice: Index of focal plane in the stack for the cell.
- Focal Intensity: Total intensity of focal plane. 
- Threshold Intensity: The threshold of intensity for determining the active slices.
- Active Slices: Index of images within the stack that are considered active (they meet the intensity threshold). 
- Total Intensity: Total intensity of the cell (across stack) in the green channel. 
- Total Background: Total intensity of the cell (across stack) in the red channel. 
- Total Intensity Normal: Total intensity of the cell after correcting for autoflorescence.
- Copy Number: Calculated copy number for the cell. 

## 2. copy_number_stats.csv`
Includes statistics for the copy number:
- Mean
- Median
- Std
- Skewness
- Kurtosis

## 3. Plots
Histogram and PDF of copy number saved as both `.png` and `.svg`.

## 4. Metadata
This pipeline supports reproducibility best practices. Each run generates a metadata file:
``metadata_proteinName_condition_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`` (Auto-generated JSON) containing:
- Timestamp (the date and time the analysis was done.)
- user
- Git commit hash (optional)
- Software versions
- os 
- os version
- Packages used
- Configuration snapshot
