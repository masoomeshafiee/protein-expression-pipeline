# Protein Expression Analysis Pipeline


A modular and reproducible image analysis pipeline to extract and quantify protein expression levels from confocal fluorescent microscopy data using Python.  
The pipeline is designed for analyzing multi-channel images (green and red channels) acquired using a dual-camera system.


## Features

- Preprocessing of dual-channel image stacks
- Compatible with Cellpose for segmentation
- Focal and active slice detection to robustly extract fluorescence signals
- Intermediate results saved to enhance traceability
- Cell autofluorescence correction and intensity normalization
- Single-cell copy number quantification
- Statistical summaries
- Flexible and customizable plotting
- Real-time logging to easily track errors and monitor pipeline progress
- Metadata logging for reproducibility
